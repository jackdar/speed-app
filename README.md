## Product Overview
The SPEED application is designed to host a searchable database in the form of a web application. The platform hosts key findings and claims from many different articles and allows easy access to summaries of these articles.

## Stack
For our application stack we are using the following technologies:
 - **Frontend:** React, Next.js
 - **Backend:** Node.js, Nest.js
 - **Database:** MongoDB

Key packages and tools used include:
 - **Styling:** TailwindCSS, RadixUI, ShadcnUI
 - **Forms:** React Hook Form, Zod
 - **Tables:** React Table

## Installation
To install and run SPEED on your local machine follow the steps listed below:

### Dependencies
Make sure the following dependencies have been installed:
 - [Node.js LTS or >=20.18.0](https://nodejs.org/en)
 - [npm (Node Package Manager)](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
 - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Steps
1. Clone the `speed-app` monolithic repository:
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pink-cute-scotland-donkeys/speed-app.git
   ```

2. Move into the `frontend/` directory:

   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

3. Install the required packages for the Next.js frontend using your package manager of choice (here I used `npm`):

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. A single environment variable must be setup for the frontend to be able to make requests to the backend:

   ```
   echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8787" >> .env
   ```

6. Congratulations! The Next.js frontend is now set up. Now for the backend.

7. Move into the `backend/` directory:

   ```
   cd ../backend
   ```

8. Install the required packages for the Nest.js backend, again using your favourite package manager:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

9. Again, the environment variables must be setup. This step requires you to already have an instance of MongoDB set up, simply replace `MONGODB_URI` with your connection string:

    ```
    echo "JWT_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET
    FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
    PORT=8787
    MONGODB_URI=YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING" >> .env
    ```


10. Thats it! Following these steps the SPEED app frontend and backend should be set up correctly.

## Usage

### Running the Next.js frontend
```
npm run dev
# or
next dev
```
The frontend is now running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (port 3000 by default)

### Running the Nest.js backend
```
npm start:dev
# or
nest start --watch
```
The backend is now running on [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787) (port 8787 by default)
